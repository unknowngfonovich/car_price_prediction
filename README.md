# car_price_prediction
This is first pet-project car-price prediction.

Folder `research` contains jupyter notebook with EDA and data-prepation.

I chose Ridge regression as type of model for car-price prediction. The metric is MAE (mean absolute error) because data contains extremely high price.
There are 2 models for type of cars: premium and regular.
